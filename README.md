# Music Player

As a member of Kernel BlockV, I developed this web app for the group to share music adding YouTube muic video and music from SounCloud. The video are added to a list fetching the thunbnail, name and artist data. The user may play them loading the songs in the player and also may create a queue. The personal queue us handled in the browser and the main list and data is managed by Apollo/GraphQR in Hasura/Heroku. You may add some tracks and share the noise!
